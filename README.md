# Factors Influencing the Adoption of Blockchain Technology in the US Industry

---

**Description:**

This research paper delves into the factors influencing the adoption of Blockchain Technology (BCT) in the United States. It analyzes the impact of technological, organizational, and environmental factors using the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) Framework. The study's findings highlight the significant influence of these factors on BCT adoption and the nuanced relationship moderated by the perception of risks. It contributes to the TOE framework by incorporating elements such as perceived volatility, organizational agility, and ecosystem sensitivity, providing a comprehensive understanding of BCT adoption dynamics in the US industry.

**Technologies and Methodology:**

The research utilized an online survey questionnaire distributed to blockchain industry specialists in the US. The survey was created using Google Forms for data collection. Data analysis was conducted using SmartPLS 4 software, applying the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. Python's Pandas library was used for data cleaning and preprocessing. The study employed a 7-point Likert scale for measuring responses and evaluated the measurement model's reliability through Cronbach's alpha, composite reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE). The structural model was assessed for significance using a bootstrapping approach, with path coefficients indicating the relationship between factors and BCT adoption intentions.
